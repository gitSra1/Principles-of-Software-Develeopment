I really liked your team switching to a JavaScript framework like React!
Picking up Jest for testing was a great idea!
When attempting to follow the README.md I got the following:

waydestallmann@Waydes-MacBook-Pro-2 Gryffindor % npm install
zsh: command not found: npm
waydestallmann@Waydes-MacBook-Pro-2 Gryffindor % 

For the next demo please share only working software. I know your team is having to learn a JavaScript framework, and that's great. I'd like to see what you can do with it. If writing tests proves too difficult please focus on working functionality.
